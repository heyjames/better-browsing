The CSS files clean up, simplify, or hide elements within websites using the Stylish Chrome Extension. The "ffz" in the bettertwitchchat-ffz.css file indicates it should be used when the FrankerFaceZ Chrome extension is also installed.

Some ublock origin rules and css files aim to remove many of Twitch's distracting/obtrusive elements such as:
* MasterOverwatch pop-up/overlay
* Chat Rules pop-up
* Follow this streamer pop-up
* Log-in pop-up
* Mature audiences overlay
* Buffering stream pop-up
* Bits
* Turn on browser notifications pop-up
* TwitchCon tickets pop-up

### bettertwitchchat-ffz.css Features
* Larger font messages
* Fewer amount of badges in front of usernames
* Same color for all usernames
* Highlighted "@" mentions and personal mentions
* Removes the black bar below the player in theater mode that Twitch created to prevent the whisper button from hiding the player controls and then moved it slightly to the left

Note: bettertwitchchat.css has a 1440p-only feature enabled by default.

Now if only I can remove the moderator badge and replace it with a customized color on their username instead.
