# clean-twitch-chat
CSS for a clean, simple, uncluttered Twitch Chat using the Stylish Chrome Extension. Use with BetterTwitchTV Chrome extension.

### Features
* Large font messages
* Fewer amount of badges in front of usernames
* Same color for all usernames
* Highlighted "@" mentions and pesronal mentions
* Removes the black bar below the player in theater mode that Twitch created to prevent the whisper button from hiding the player controls and moved it slightly to the left instead

Note: 1440p feature only enabled by default.

Now if only I can remove the moderator badge and replace it with a customized color on their username instead.
